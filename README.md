# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-and-Tracking-System

This project is designed to implement a face recognition pipeline. It utilizes models such as YOLO and Adaface for various stages of face recognition and attribute recognition.

# Features
Face Detection: Using YOLO model to detect faces in images or video streams.
<br>
Face Recognition: Identifying and verifying individuals using the Adaface model.
<br>
Attribute Recognition: Recognizing and tracking attributes of individuals using deep learning models and computer vision techniques.
